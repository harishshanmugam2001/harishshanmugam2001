## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate data science student with a keen interest in analyzing and interpreting complex data to uncover meaningful insights. With skills in programming languages such as Python and R, and proficiency in libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, I focused on building data-driven solutions. Always eager to learn and take on new challenges, I am working towards mastering machine learning techniques and statistical analysis. Outside of academics. I am excited to contribute to the data science field through hands-on projects and collaborations.
